Ecoleta application - end to end application for registering recycle collection points: Application made during Next Level Week

# What's inside?
Here you have a **web** application, a **server** for backend and a **mobile** application.

## Web Application
Made using React with TypeScript. This page is used to register a new recycle collection point. And perhaps it also needs your location permission.
### How to run?
Just run `npm start`. Make sure you have the *Server Application* up and running.

## Server Application
Made with TypeScript! This contains the REST API used by the Web Application and the Mobile Application
> Please run it first in order to run everything else.
### How to run?
Run `npm run migrate` then `npm run seed` to generate the database and to populate it with data, respectively. Then, run `npm run dev`.

**Protip:** Do not trust any sqlite file in this repo, if any. It won't kill you, but it may contain arbitrary test data.

## Mobile Application
Made with React Native. This application is used by the final user, in order to locate and contact recycle collection points in his area. It will need your location permission.

### How to run?
Just `npm start` it. Also, make sure you have **Expo** in your PATH in order to do it successfully. 

# Final Words
I just loved using this stack. It seems so flexible! There are some to-do items indeed, and it gave me so many insights on how to work and mix it with other technologies.

This was possible thanks to the Rocketseat staff that put together this Next Level Week. Thanks, people! It was mind blowing!
